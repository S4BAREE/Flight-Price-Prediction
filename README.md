# Flight-Price-Prediction âœˆðŸ›©
A Flight price Prediction Regression model is an algorithmic approach that uses machine learning techniques to analyze data and predict the Flight Price . 
##  Introduction
Here you can get information regarding Flight Price Prediction , The goal is to predict which flight has affordable price ,  duration etc. 
## Overview 
Flight price prediction is a data science task that involves developing models to estimate the cost of airline tickets for various flight routes. With the dynamic and fluctuating nature of flight prices, predicting accurate fares can be a valuable tool for travelers, airlines, and travel agencies.
## Methodology /Code Structure
 Data Collection: Collect a comprehensive dataset containing historical flight data, including features such as departure and arrival airports, dates, 
 airlines, flight durations, and prices.
 Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
 Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the available data that can impact flight prices.
 Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. Typically, the training set constitutes a major portion of the data (e.g., 80%), while the remaining portion is used for testing the model's performance.
 Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm for flight price prediction. Common choices include random forests, XGBoosting. 
 Model Evaluation: The trained model using the testing dataset. Calculation & evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), or mean percentage error (MPE) to assess the model's accuracy and performance.
 Model Fine-tuning: Perform model fine-tuning by adjusting hyperparameters to further improve performance. Utilize techniques like grid search or randomized search to explore different parameter combinations and select the optimal ones based on evaluation results.
